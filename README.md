# Local-Alignment-Score

# Description
local_alignment_score is a Python function that computes the score of a local alignment between two sequences using a scoring matrix. This approach is used to identify the most similar region between two sequences, allowing for the alignment to be done in a local context rather than globally across the entire sequence.

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to calculate the optimal alignment score, considering match scores, mismatch penalties, and indel penalties. The function returns the highest alignment score found in the local region of the two sequences.

# Features
* Computes the local alignment score between two sequences.
* Handles gaps (indels) and mismatches with penalties.
* Returns the highest score found for a local alignment.

# Function
```
def local_alignment_score(seq1, seq2, match_score, mismatch_penalty, indel_penalty):
    # Creates a matrix to store the alignment scores
    # Returns the highest alignment score for local sequence matching
```


# Parameters
* seq1 (str): The first input sequence.
* seq2 (str): The second input sequence.
* match_score (int): The score for a match between corresponding characters in the sequences.
* mismatch_penalty (int): The penalty score for a mismatch between characters.
* indel_penalty (int): The penalty score for an insertion or deletion (gap).

# Returns
* int: The score of the best local alignment between seq1 and seq2.

# Example

```
seq1 = "A--ATAGCGACGCCTCGA"
seq2 = "CCGATA-CGATA-CATAGC"
match_score = 1
mismatch_penalty = 3
indel_penalty = 1

alignment_score = local_alignment_score(seq1, seq2, match_score, mismatch_penalty, indel_penalty)
print("Local alignment score:", alignment_score)
```
Expected Output:

Local alignment score: 5


# Applications
* Bioinformatics: Used in sequence alignment tasks, such as finding the most similar subregion between two DNA or protein sequences.
* Computational Biology: Helps in identifying conserved regions between sequences, which can be vital in evolutionary studies.
* Genomics: Used for local sequence alignments in genome assembly and comparison.
